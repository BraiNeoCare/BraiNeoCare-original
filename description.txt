GAT_model_94 - artifacts are there and model is similar to paper
GAT_model_96 - artifacts are there and CNN has skip connections with 0.2 dropout (N=32,64  K=3,5)
GAT_model_97 - artifacts are there and CNN has residual connections with 0.1 dropout (N=32,64  K=3,5)
GAT_model_rem_art - artifacts are removed with *3000000 method and consists of residual connections (N=32,64  K=3,5)
saved_model_weights_90 - basic CNN with 4s epochs
saved_model_weights_93 - basic CNN with 12s epochs 


all the followings are for artifacts removed signals 

history_GAT_94 - model is similar to which in the paper
history_GAT_rem_art_1 - model is similar to which in the paper but has skip connections
history_GAT_rem_art - our model (N=32,64  K=3,5)
history_GAT_without_skip - our model without residual connections
