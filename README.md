# Deep Learning for Real-Time Neonatal Seizure Detection with Reduced Montage

Notice: This project was originally carried out in Ubuntu 22.04.4 LTS

## Problem background

* Neonatal seizures are epileptic seizures that occur in infants during the first four weeks after birth. This duration is the most vulnerable time in a lifetime to develop seizures capable of causing significant harm to the developing brain, necessitating prompt diagnosis followed by treatment.

* Detecting neonatal seizures is particularly challenging because they often manifest subtly and can be mistaken for normal physiological behaviors. Therefore, having an objective monitoring method is critical.

* Hence we introduce a new efficient yet reliable and accurate AI model to detect neonatal seizures with reduced electrode montage. Here we have used only 9 electrodes and 12 EEG channels namely ["Fp1-T3","T3-O1","Fp1-C3","C3-O1","Fp2-C4","C4-O2","Fp2-T4","T4-O2","T3-C3","C3-Cz","Cz-C4","C4-T4"].
